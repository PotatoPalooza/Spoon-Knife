## Project organization
I am currently planning on doing a project in computer vision involving NeRFs or Neural Radiance Fields. Because this project will be very technical with a small team I think a common repository would work well as it would reduce merging complexity and ensure a rapid workflow for quickly testing different ideas. However if the project starts and many people are trying to work on the exact same part of the codebase then a blessed repository would be the best option to switch to.
